- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), providing a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.

- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a precise and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif that complements the modern feel with a neutral and machined look.
- Use clean, line-based icons to represent services and solutions. These icons should be consistent in style and weight across the website.
- Employ a grid-based layout to maintain consistency and structure across all pages. Use whitespace generously to avoid clutter and improve readability.
